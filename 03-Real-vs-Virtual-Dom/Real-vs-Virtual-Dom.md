<!-- Real DOM vs Virtual DOM  -->

<!-- Real DOM (Browser DOM)                                          Virtual DOM (React) -->

Directly updates the actual webpage.               ||     A lightweight copy of the Real DOM.

Slow when many updates happen.                     ||     Fast — updates happen in memory first.

Every change reloads the entire part of the UI.    ||     Only the changed part goes to the Real DOM.
